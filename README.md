# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes customer data to identify patterns and predict whether a customer is likely to leave a service, helping businesses improve retention strategies.

Key Features

Loads and preprocesses customer data, handling missing values and categorical features.

Implements classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to predict churn.

Evaluates model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Visualizes feature importance, churn distribution, and prediction results for actionable insights.

Tech Stack

Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Use Cases

Identify customers at risk of leaving a service.

Helps businesses implement targeted retention strategies.

Provides hands-on experience with classification, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
